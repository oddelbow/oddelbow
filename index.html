    <p>If you're reading this, I probably told you to check this out. If you stumbled here on your own, I'm so sorry in advance. None of this will be worth your time.</p>

    <p>I've been creating art for over a decade, and I wanted a place to compile everything. Here it is.</p> 

    <p>When I first started making art, I was limited to shitty songs on the ukulele. I could barely sing, and any more than 4 strings seemed like a death sentence. I slowly taught myself to sing without sounding like a horse that had been punched in the throat. Day by day, I learned how to force my cumbersome fingers into coherent shapes on a guitar neck.</p> 
    <p>I wrote and I wrote and I wrote. I practiced, as Kurt Vonnegut would say, the arrangement of twenty-six phonetic symbols, ten numerals, and about eight punctuation marks. This resulted in songs, poems, and more recently, a couple novels.</p>
